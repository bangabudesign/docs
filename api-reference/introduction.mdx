RapidSender's APIs use `HTTP verbs` and a `RESTful` endpoint structure. A Bearer token is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON (although we provide a GET alternative for requests), using UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded values.

## Api Endpoint

In order to use the APIs of the MessageBird Connectivity Platform, you need to have an account and log in to **the Dashboard**.

```json
https://rapidsender.net/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

With each API call, you will need to set request headers including your Bearer tokens to authenticate yourself.

<Note>
  Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub. See API Access Key Security for more information.
